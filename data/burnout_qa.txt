1. What Is Burnout?

Answer: Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged exposure to excessive stress. The World Health Organization classifies burnout as an "occupational phenomenon," meaning it results from chronic workplace stress

2. What Causes Burnout?

Answer: When we don't get a chance to properly rest and recuperate from a stressful event we expose ourselves to a variety of disorders and illnesses, including: hormonal disorders, muscle tension and aches, diabetes, depression, irritability, and insomnia (to name a few). Continuous stress on our body over a prolonged period of time disturbs our endocrine system, which is responsible for regulating our "fight or flight" response. Once disturbed, our endocrine system begins to take over brain functions that would be considered "non essential" in an emergency situation, like: sleep, digestion, and the reproductive system. In contrast, it amplifies those we would need in an emergency, including muscular and cardiovascular functions. At this point, we begin experiencing burnout, and if we don't make lifestyle changes we head down the road to overwhelming emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion.

3. Is Burnout the Same as Stress?

Answer: No, while burnout is the result of excessive and prolonged stress, it isn't the same as experiencing too much stress. Stress is a part of normal, everyday life, and is typically experienced in short bursts in response to specific events. Stress can help you perform better on certain tasks in the short-term, and by and large involves a feeling of "too much." Feeling like there is too much pressure, too much to do, and so on. You may experience stress several days in a row, particularly if you're working on a difficult project, but stress will typically lessen or disappear entirely once the project is complete. Symptoms of stress may include: over-engagement, over-reactive emotions, hyperactivity, loss of energy, anxiety, and physical damage to your body. Burnout is experienced when we are exposed to excessive and prolonged stress and develop a feeling of "not having enough." We don't have enough motivation, energy, engagement in our work, and so on. While stress can have you feeling like you're drowning, burnout leaves you feeling all dried up. And, unlike stress, it isn't always easy to notice burnout happening. Symptoms of burnout may include: exhaustion (both physically and mentally), disengagement, overwhelming dread, loss of motivation, blunted emotions, depersonalization, a feeling of emptiness, depression, and emotional damage.

4. What Are Some Examples of Situations that Cause Burnout?

Answer: Some causes may include: unclear goals or job expectations, working within a dysfunctional team, having an excessive workload, getting a lack of recognition, having little support, or working a role that doesn't align with your ambitions

5. When does burnout happen?

Answer: Burnout can happen when you experience a period of unrelenting stress linked to workplace expectations, real or perceived. When we expect too much of ourselves, when we don't believe we can do something "perfectly", feel incompetent, inadequate, or under appreciated for our efforts it negatively affects our relationship with our work and our health. Couple this with unreasonable demands from management and a job role that isn't good fit and you've got a recipe for burnout.

6. Does Burnout Only Happen During Bad Times?

Answer: No, burnout is not reserved for the bad times. It has happened to many business owners while their company performance was at its peak. Whether you're experiencing prolonged and excessive stress because your business or company isn't doing well, or because it is doing so well that you're afraid of slipping up, your body and mind lack rest.

12. How Do You Spot Burnout in Employees?

Answer: Burnout can be chronic in nature and cause employees' performance to suffer. Knowing how to spot the early stages of burnout in your team will help you be proactive in addressing the areas where they need help. If you notice an employee has become uncharacteristically disengaged in their work and seems exhausted it might be time to start a conversation. Suddenly making a lot of mistakes in their work, acting distant, being increasingly absent, showing heightened sensitivity, and extreme thinking are also signs of burnout to look out for.

13. How Do You Support an Employee Experiencing Burnout?

Answer: First, you want to figure out why they are experiencing burnout. It might be that they are working too long of hours, trying to be the "perfect" employee, or are working on tasks they don't feel they have the skills and abilities to complete. It could also be that the expectations being placed on them are unrealistic. Whatever the case may be, you'll want to address their concerns with compassion and help them find solutions. If the employee is working extra hours because they feel the pressure to be seen as a "hard worker", you could set a goal cutoff time for them to end their day and encourage them to take their breaks. You might also want to revisit and adjust your expectations for their role. They may have more on their plate than you know. Revisiting your expectations can help relieve pressure. 

There is no one size fits all approach to take when approaching an employee experiencing burnout, but checking in with your team members on a regular basis can help you spot burnout signs early and turn things around.

14. How Do You Treat Burnout?

15. How Do You Prevent Burnout?
Answer: Being mindful of the stress your job is putting on you is an important place to start. Look for areas in your life where you aren't taking care of yourself. Maybe you're not giving yourself enough time to get a good night's sleep? Perhaps you've stopped going to the gym, or doing a hobby you love? Are you seeing friends, or talking to your family about how you're feeling?Once you identify areas that need improvement you need to find the time to do something for yourself every day (even if it is small, like going for a 10 minute walk at lunch). Having things you enjoy doing outside of work will not only help you bring down your stress levels, but can help you find joy in your job again.
